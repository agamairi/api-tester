# Flutter API Testing App üöÄ

This is a mobile-optimized API testing application built with Flutter. It allows you to send various types of HTTP requests, view the responses, and manage a local history of your interactions. The app is designed with a clean, Material 3-compliant UI and features one-handed usability. All data is stored locally on your device.

-----

## Features ‚ú®

  * **HTTP Methods:** Supports `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `HEAD` requests.
  * **Request Customization:** Easily set the URL, headers, and request body.
  * **Authentication:** Handles `Bearer` and `Basic` token authentication.
  * **Response Viewer:** Displays the status code, duration, and response body. Includes a toggle to switch between **Raw** and **Prettified** JSON.
  * **Local History:** Saves all your requests and responses to a local SQLite database for easy access. You can replay, edit, or delete past requests.
  * **Theming:** Customizable theme with a color picker and a dark mode toggle.
  * **Mobile-First UI:** Designed for comfortable one-handed use with a bottom navigation bar.

## Project Structure üìÅ

The project follows a standard Flutter architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

  * `lib/main.dart`: The entry point of the application, handling global state management and theme.
  * `lib/screens/`: Contains the main pages of the app (`RequestBuilder`, `HistoryPage`, `SettingsPage`).
  * `lib/widgets/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `MethodDropdown`, `HeaderList`).
  * `lib/services/`: Business logic for API calls (`ApiService`) and local database operations (`DbService`).
  * `lib/models/`: Data models for requests, responses, and environments.

-----

## Dependencies üì¶

  * `http`: A composable, future-based library for making HTTP requests.
  * `sqflite`: A plugin for SQLite database access.
  * `path_provider`: Finds the correct platform-specific paths for storing data.
  * `provider`: A simple, yet powerful, state management solution.
  * `flutter_material_color_picker`: A widget to pick a color from the Material Design color palette.
  * `flutter_secure_storage`: A secure storage solution for sensitive data like tokens.
  * `oauth2`: A library for handling OAuth 2.0 authorization flows.

## Getting Started üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Prerequisites

  * Flutter SDK installed.
  * An IDE (e.g., VS Code or Android Studio) with Flutter and Dart plugins.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-api-tester.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd flutter-api-tester
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  Run the app on a connected device or emulator:
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

-----

## Test Server üß™

A simple Node.js server is included in the `./server` directory to help you test the app's functionality. This server is set up to respond to various HTTP requests.

### Usage

1.  Navigate to the server directory:
    ```sh
    cd server
    ```
2.  Install the Node.js dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the server:
    ```sh
    node test_server.js
    ```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`. You can now use this URL in the app to test different methods and responses.
